Here’s a **clear summary** of what that JavaScript code is doing 👇

---

### 🌐 **Overall Purpose**

This script runs as soon as the HTML document has fully loaded (`DOMContentLoaded`).
It handles **three main features** of your webpage:

1. **Mobile navigation toggle (hamburger menu)**
2. **Dark/light mode switching**
3. **Opening Login and Signup pages**

---

### ⚙️ **Step-by-step Summary**

#### 1. **Selects Key DOM Elements**

It first grabs important HTML elements like:

* The hamburger icon (`#hamburger`)
* The navigation links (`#nav-links`)
* Login and Signup buttons
* The dark mode toggle icon
* The `<body>` element (to apply dark mode classes)

---

#### 2. **Defines Helper Functions**

Each function handles one specific task:

* **`toggleMobileMenu()`**
  → Adds or removes the `"active"` class from `.nav-links`, which shows or hides the mobile menu.

* **`openLogin()` & `openSignup()`**
  → Open `/login` and `/signup` pages in new browser tabs.

* **`toggleTheme()`**
  → Switches between light and dark themes depending on what’s currently active.

* **`applyTheme(theme)`**
  → Actually applies the chosen theme:

  * Adds/removes `"dark-mode"` class on `<body>`
  * Swaps the moon/sun icon
  * Saves the user’s choice in `localStorage`

* **`initializeTheme()`**
  → Reads the previously saved theme from `localStorage` (default = light) and applies it when the page first loads.

---

#### 3. **Adds Event Listeners**

Connects the functions to UI interactions:

* Clicking the hamburger icon → toggles menu
* Clicking Login or Signup → opens respective pages
* Clicking the dark mode icon → toggles theme

---

#### 4. **Runs Initialization**

Finally, when the page loads, it calls `initializeTheme()` to restore the saved light/dark theme preference.

---

✅ **In short:**
This script makes the page **interactive and personalized**, handling:

* Menu visibility
* Theme persistence
* Navigation to login/signup pages
