## 1. Main Container

This is the top-level `div` that wraps and centers the form on the page.

* **Main Element:** `<div>`
* **Key Class:** `main-container`

---

## 2. Form Container

This is the central card that holds the heading, form, and message elements.

* **Main Element:** `<div>`
* **Key Class:** `form-container`
* **Sub-components:**
    * `<h2>`: The main heading "Reset Password".
    * `<form>`: The main form element.
        * **ID:** `resetPasswordForm` (This is the **key selector** your JavaScript will use).
    * **Input Groups:** The form has **2 `div.input-group`** elements.
        * **Structure:** Each group contains a single `<input>` tag using a `placeholder` attribute (e.g., "New Password") instead of a `<label>`.
    * `<button type="submit">`: The "Reset Password" button that submits the form.
    * `<p id="message">` and `<p id="error">`: These are **key elements** for your JavaScript. They are currently empty and will be used to display success or error messages to the user after the form is submitted.

## 3. Assets & Scripts

These are the files loaded at the end of the `<body>` to add functionality.

* **CSS:**
    * `/css/forgotPassword.css`: The custom stylesheet for this page.
* **JavaScript:**
    * `axios.min.js`: The Axios library, used to send the new password data to your server.
    * `/js/config.js`: (Likely contains your `BASE_URL`).
    * `/js/reset-Password.js`: The script that will:
        1.  Get the `token` from the URL.
        2.  Listen for the `resetPasswordForm` submission.
        3.  Send the new passwords and token to the server using Axios.
        4.  Display success or error in the `<p id="message">` or `<p id="error">` tags.
