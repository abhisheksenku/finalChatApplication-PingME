## 4. Assets & Scripts

These are the files loaded at the end of the `<body>` to add functionality.

* **CSS:**
    * `/css/login.css`: The custom stylesheet that defines all the classes used above.
* **JavaScript:**
    * `axios.min.js`: The Axios library, which will be used to send the login data to your server.
    * `/js/config.js`: (Likely contains your `BASE_URL`).
    * `/js/login.js`: The script that will handle the `loginForm` submission, send the data via Axios, and (on success) save the token and redirect the user.
